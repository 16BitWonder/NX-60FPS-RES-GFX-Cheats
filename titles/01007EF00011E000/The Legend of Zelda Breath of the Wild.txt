Resolution Hacks By @Hazerou

Notes;

1.) FPS will drop straight to 30 and Game Speed will slow down whenever Switch can't handle 60 FPS.

2.) Resolution Hacks will not work properly if you have a Resolution / Disable Dynamic Resolution Patch/Mod.

3.) Do not activate both Handheld and Docked Resolution Hacks at the same time.
