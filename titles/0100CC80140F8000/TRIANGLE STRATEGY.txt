=====

[RRS] is Render Resolution Scale.
Dynamic Resolution Function was already OFF by default. But I put the Maximal & Minimal Screen Percentage values same alongside RRS.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.

Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.

Update#1;

Fixed the wrong address for Minimal Screen Percentage.

Update#2;

Added [CHROM AB] Chromatic Aberration.
