=====

[Upscale Quality] Is noticeable (more usable) when using lower RRS + AA OFF, AA Very Low or AA Low.

Type-0: Nearest filtering

Type-1: Simple Bilinear

Type-2: Directional blur with unsharp mask upsample.

Type-3: 5-tap Catmull-Rom bicubic, approximating Lanczos 2. (default)

Type-4: 13-tap Lanczos 3.

Type-5: 36-tap Gaussian-filtered unsharp mask (very expensive, but good for extreme upsampling)


[RRS] is Render Resolution Scale and it disables Dynamic Resolution Function.
Please use;
Handheld RRS for Handheld Mode.
Docked RRS for Docked Mode.

Some GFX Codes has no Function/Effect to the Game.

I also removed;


[AA High (Default TAA)]
[AA Very High]
[AA Max]

Because the Game will crash if one of those is used.

Messing with the settings especially[AA] too fast/frequent may Crash the Game.
If you have EdiZon Overlay or any Overlay to use Cheats, do it in Nintendo Switch Home Menu to reduce chance of Crashing the Game.
And Just activate the ones you like then get playing.
