1. Do not open issues requesting cheats, asking for assistance with using cheats - ask for help here - https://discord.gg/VndKxFg7EE
2. Do not open issues for emulator issues as cheats are designed for original hardware usage only
2. Only report issues with the database which includes the following
- Incorrect TitleIDs for games
- Incorrect BuildIDs for games
- Incorrect file structure
- Cheats that are not correctly formatted
- Cheats that do not work (First, ensure cheats are loaded correctly and selectable by Edizon and are enabled - if no cheats load at all, that is an issue with your setup we can only help on the Discord - https://discord.gg/VndKxFg7EE)
