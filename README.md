## About

A complete database of 60FPS cheats, resolution cheats and general graphics cheats for Nintendo Switch games.

These cheats are designed for usage on real Nintendo Switch hardware running custom firmware and may not work on emulators.

Download these cheats directly on your Switch using [**AIO-Switch-Updater**](https://github.com/ChanseyIsTheBest/NX-60FPS-RES-GFX-Cheats#cheat-downloads)

You can search for games that have cheats by using the automatically updated [**Games List**](https://github.com/ChanseyIsTheBest/NX-60FPS-RES-GFX-Cheats/blob/main/GAMES.md) 
* selecting the game **NAME** will take you to a file that contains a credit for the cheat author(s) as well as any information they've included about the cheat
* selecting a **TITLE ID** will take you to the game's TitleID directory which contains the credit/info file and the cheats directory for the game
* selecting a **BUILD ID** or **VERSION** will take you directly to the corresponding cheat file

To mass download the entire cheat repository on a computer click "Code" -> "Download ZIP", extract the zip and copy the TitleID folders to your SD card under `sdmc:/atmosphere/contents` for usage

## Recommended tools

The latest versions of the following tools are recommended to get the most out of these cheats. Without overclocking most of the cheats will not work to their proper potential and in many cases handheld profiles should be forced to allow for more performance headroom.

#### Custom firmware:

[**Atmosph√®re**](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)

#### Cheat downloads:

[**AIO-Switch-Updater**](https://github.com/HamletDuFromage/aio-switch-updater) to download cheats from this database directly on your Switch either as a batch download for all detected installed titles or as individual cheats for detected installed titles

#### Overclocking:

**You are responsible for your own usage of these cheats and any overclock settings you choose to apply!**

[**sys-clk**](https://github.com/retronx-team/sys-clk) homebrew overclocking/underclocking system module and frontend

Alternatively the fork of sys-clk supplied with [**Switch-OC-Suite**](https://github.com/KazushiMe/Switch-OC-Suite)

#### Overlays:

The [**Tesla sysmodule**](https://github.com/WerWolv/nx-ovlloader) and [**Overlay menu**](https://github.com/WerWolv/Tesla-Menu)

#### FPS, clock speed, temperature monitoring and more:

The [**SaltyNX sysmodule**](https://github.com/masagrator/SaltyNX) along with [**Status Monitor Overlay**](https://github.com/masagrator/Status-Monitor-Overlay) and the [**NX-FPS plugin**](https://github.com/masagrator/NX-FPS)

#### Cheat software:

[**EdiZon-SE homebrew**](https://github.com/tomvita/EdiZon-SE) and this special version of [**EdiZon Overlay**](https://github.com/proferabg/EdiZon-Overlay)

#### Other:

[**ReverseNX-Tool homebrew**](https://github.com/masagrator/ReverseNX-Tool) for forcing docked mode in handheld or vice versa as well as the [**ReverseNX-RT overlay and plugin**](https://github.com/masagrator/ReverseNX-RT) for performing the same functions in-game on the fly (note that an alternative version of ReverseNX-RT is already supplied with Switch-OC-Suite)
