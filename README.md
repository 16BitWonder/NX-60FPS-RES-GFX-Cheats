## About

A complete database of 60FPS cheats, resolution cheats and general graphics cheats for Nintendo Switch games.

These cheats are designed for usage on real Nintendo Switch hardware running custom firmware and may not work on emulators.

To mass download cheats click Code -> Download ZIP and extract the TitleID folders to your SD card under `atmosphere/contents`

You can search for games that have cheats by using the [**Games.md**](https://github.com/karmicpumpkin/NX-60FPS-RES-GFX-Cheats/blob/main/GAMES.md)

## Recommended tools

The latest versions of the following tools are recommended to get the most out of these cheats. Without overclocking most of the cheats will not work to their proper potential and in many cases handheld profiles should be forced to allow for more performance headroom.

#### Custom firmware:

[**Atmosph√®re**](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere)

#### Overclocking:

**You are responsible for your usage of these cheats and any overclock you decide to apply.**

[**sys-clk**](https://github.com/retronx-team/sys-clk) homebrew overclocking/underclocking system module and frontend

Alternatively the fork of sys-clk supplied with [**Switch-OC-Suite**](https://github.com/KazushiMe/Switch-OC-Suite)

#### Overlays:

The [**Tesla sysmodule**](https://github.com/WerWolv/nx-ovlloader) and [**Overlay menu**](https://github.com/WerWolv/Tesla-Menu)

#### FPS, clock speed, temperature monitoring and more:

The [**SaltyNX sysmodule**](https://github.com/masagrator/SaltyNX) along with [**Status Monitor Overlay**](https://github.com/masagrator/Status-Monitor-Overlay) and the [**NX-FPS plugin**](https://github.com/masagrator/NX-FPS)

#### Cheat software:

[**EdiZon-SE homebrew**](https://github.com/tomvita/EdiZon-SE) and this special version of [**EdiZon Overlay**](https://github.com/proferabg/EdiZon-Overlay)

#### Other:

[**ReverseNX-Tool homebrew**](https://github.com/masagrator/ReverseNX-Tool) for forcing docked mode in handheld or vice versa as well as the [**ReverseNX-RT overlay and plugin**](https://github.com/masagrator/ReverseNX-RT) for performing the same functions in-game on the fly (note that an alternative version of ReverseNX-RT is already supplied with Switch-OC-Suite)
